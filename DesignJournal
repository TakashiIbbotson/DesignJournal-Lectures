####<center><i>The History of Design </center>
#####<center>Cave Paintings.</center>

Art and design has been around for a very long time and has evolved from very basic naturally created pieces to digial design and modern art.  The earliest cave painting to date was found in El Castillo in the Caves to Kells.  These crimson hands were created by Neanderthols approximatly 40,800 years ago and were discovered in 2012.

There are many famous aboriginal cave painings.  Many of these cave drawings were of animals and other natural art as they would draw what they could see.  The artists used natural resources with matte, plain coloursand made use of dots to create texture and pattern.

The development from Cave paintings to modern art is phonomenal and it is interesting to see the skill in the work especially with their lack of resources.  Modern art however can be based on aboriginal art.  For example Prometheus has a famous Scottish cave painting within it's scenes in which the painting has been modernised with scientific equiptment within the film.  The original drawing was taken and placed on a large digital screen combined with the use of bright neon colours and shapes to create a futuristic effect.  This combination of ancient and modern art create a very nice effect.

History has been incredibely influencial in the world of modern art within the Music Industry especially.  The album cover for Keane - Under the Iron Sea was designed by a Japanese artist and was heavily based on The Great Wave off Kanagawa.

In addition to this the album cover for We Are the Night by the Chemical Brothers is almost identical to The Lonely Metropolitan by Herbert Bayer.

Da Vinci's Vatruvian man can also be referenced back to history alhough it in itself is in history now.  This piece is based on notes for Vatruvius' devine proporion scale.  The diagram shows the perfect proportions for a person to be.
<br>
<br>
<center><i>The Vatruvian Man.</i></center>

This is a key point in history where scale and proportion became important.  You can see the comparison between the thought for scale put into this piece and neandarthol art.

The Vatruvian man follows The Golden Ratio.  The Golden Ratio is a scale used within design.  It explores the appearence of Phi (1.618).  The Fibbinacci sequence is a mathematical design.  The number can be found by adding the two numbers before it.  The Golden Ratio is created by using these numbers in a spiral.

<center><img src="http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/images/fibonacci-spiral.gif" style="width:304px;height:240px"></center>

The Golden Ratio has been used by many influential artists and was used in abundance by Da Vinci.

Week Three

The 1900's are the century of change for art and design.  Art movements dominated the 20th century and technology grew at such an unbelivably rapid pace,  From the invention of the photograph to the moving image to the telephone to light bulb.  The first photograph was taken by Joseph Nicephore Niepce and was a photograph of some buildings he had taken from his window.
<br>

A little further on from this Louis Daguerre was using light sensitive Iodine.  A famous photo of his is the Boulevard du Temple in 1838.

<br>Matthew Brady was  very famous 19th century photographer and was known as the 'Father of Photojournalism'.  His images mainly consisted of celebrities and war.  This made him almost the inventor of paraparazzi.

Roger Fenton also took war photography and has some iconic images of the civil war.  Other artists have taken influence such as Paul Seawright and attempted to recreate this start feeling of death with a modern approach.

Moving Image officially began in the 1800's however it argueable to an extent that cave paintings are a form of moving image as they represent the movement of natrual beings such as animals.

Before the invention of moving imagine people used image and craft in order to create the illusion of moving image.  Examples of this are thaumatropes, zoetropes and phenakistoscopes.

In 29 Sony created the world's largest Zoetrope at 33 feet.  This advertised ther Bravia TV and showed a footballer.  This interesting mix of old and new moving image was heavily praised and received a lot of good review.

In 1882 Eudweard Muybridge created 'The Horse in Motion' in order to answer the question 'Do horses ever lift all four hooves off the ground when running?'.  He took multiple photographs along a racetrack and put them in order to see if the myth was true which it turned out to be.  Later the photographs were put together to create a moving image almost like a GIF.

the first motion picture was created by the Lumeer brothers and was called 'L'Arroseur arrosé' (The Waterer Watered) in 1895

The Industrial Revolution changed a lot within the art and design industry.  Until then everything was done by hand and mass copies werenear impossible without a lot of time and dedication.

The advent of Graphic Design was huge.  People would come to Graphic Designers and ask for them to promote their material.  The graphic designer would use any  typeface available so the piece would look like a mixmatch.  Although this was simply down to convenience this art style became very influential.

Japonism opened the world especislly France to the Japanese trade.  Prior to the Japanese art movement art was very stiff and posed.  An example of this is 'The Meeting' by Gustone Courbel in 1854.

The Art Noveau is also linked to Morris.  This style of art used very fluent flowing curves.  A good example of this was 'La Touree du Chat Noir avec Rodolphne Mucha' by Alphanse Mucha.  Mucha was famous for entering a competition for Sarah Baernhardt's poster design in which he won with his unique design.

At this time art had become simpler.  Macintosh used watercolour in a similar artstyle to Tolkien and Morris.  Roses were a recurring theme within his work.  He used very long, clean lines and simple design within his archetecture and furniture design.
